<h3> Project: Low Grade Gliomas (LGG) Growth Pattern Analysis </h3>

**Notes:**

- Gliobastomas can be primary or secondary.
	- Primary tumors orginate de novo in >90% of the cases.
	- Secondary tumors progress from lower grade tumors like anaplastic astrocytoma.
- Location of tumor and growth pattern correlate with the genotype of the tumor.
	- The tumor genotype is in turn highly correlated with the prognosis and therapy response to chemotherapy.
	- This was mentioned in the paper by Zlatescu et al. in 2001 which was for oligodendrogliomas.
- Tumor types:
	- Multiloblar: The tumors that extend into different lobes.
	- Multifocal: Tumors that appear in several distinct locations.
	- Bilateral: Tumors that traverse the corpus collossum and extend into other cerebral hemisphere.
- Tumors maybe biologically distinct even if they are histologically similar
	- This was also shown by Zlatescu et al.
	- *Histology is the microscopic analysis of the cell anatomy.*

**We can make a case that:**

- Given an MRI scan, if we can infer the growth pattern and the location of the tumor region, it is logical to assume that there will be a correlation between these quantities and the genomic profile of the patient (which in turn, is associated with the patient response to treatment or prognosis).

**Available Datasets**

    todo

We need to find datasets that may be acquired in time, ie. the patients are scanned at varying time intervals to measure the progression of tumor. So far I've found the following datasets:

- Dataset on multiple sclerosis. Patients scanned at varying intervals to measure disease progression

Most of the brain MRI datasets that are available in public domain do not provide images taken at varying intervals of time. There may be some fMRI datasets though. I'm still looking.
